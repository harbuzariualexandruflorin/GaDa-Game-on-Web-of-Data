            <p>
                GaDa stands for Game on web of Data. It is a service-oriented game where the player is matched up
                against the computer in a game of cards which requires strategic hand management and critical thinking.
                At the start of the game, the player is asked to take a quiz that will determine the strength of the 10
                cards he will be given. The cards represent various characters ranging from tiny pokemons to
                well-established superheroes and the goal for the player is to amass more points than the opponent with
                the cards he is dealt with. Then, both the player and the computer will take turns placing cards that
                have a higher power level than the one previously placed until they have no card with a higher score in
                hand
            </p>
            <p>
                Each card will have a power level assigned to it before the game starts. The individual power levels of
                the cards are stored in a database and are calculated based on the metadata received from various
                superhero API available, such as Pokemon, Star Wars, Marvel. The quiz given at the start of the game
                will also be based on the character’s metadata and will reward the user with better cards, provided he
                answers correctly to the questions.
            </p>

        <section id="solution">
            <h2><span>2. </span>Proposed solution</h2>
            <p>GaDa will incorporate the following main functionalities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>generation of the initial deck according to certain selected preferences</li>
                <li>the possibility of playing one or more card-based games, 5 rounds each</li>
                <li>answering the quiz questions to get better playing cards</li>
                <li>recalculating the score of a card according to the characteristics of the opponent's current card
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On top of providing useful functionality to end users, GaDa will align itself to the latest software
                engineering best practices and approaches by incorporating the following principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>modular architecture based on services</li>
                <li>performance and scalability</li>
                <li>well-documented, developer-friendly API</li>

            </figure>
            <p>
                The project will have a modular architecture based on microservices. New microservices can be added in
                the future and the only component responsible for managing this change is the API Gateway. The client is
                not required to know such details.
            </p>
            <p>The project was carried out in 3 main steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step 1: generate the quiz questions and cards based on the given APIs.</li>
                <li>Step 2: develop the quiz microservice and card service by creating the game logic using the
                    previously generated elements</li>
                <li>Step 3: create a user-friendly interface.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Next, we explain each service:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>Quiz Service</code> is responsible for managing the quiz part of the game. The microservice
                    generates a
                    question based on card data and checks the given answer by querying DBpedia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>Cards Service</code>: is responsible for the card game’s logic. The system admin will have the
                    possibility
                    to initialise the database or update it by querying data from the 4 established APIs (Marvel,
                    Pokemon, Star Trek, Star Wars). The microservice will manage the battle between 2 selected cards to
                    decide the winner and the resulting score.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <section id="generation">
                <h3><span>3.1 </span>Question and Card Generation</h3>
                <p>Before making the game itself, we needed to create a power system based on the metadata given from
                    various APIs. In order to achieve our goal, we acquired various metadata by calling the Marvel
                    Comics, Star Wars, Star Trek and Pokemon APIs. Afterwards, we used that data to determine each
                    individual character’s power level and to create connections in the ontology so we can later
                    formulate the quiz questions. These questions will be made using various templates.The answer is
                    verified by making SparkQL queries to retrieve information about various characters and thus, the
                    user’s knowledge of the in-game universe is tested. The result of this quiz will determine what type
                    of cards the user will obtain for the current round. If the result is good, then the average score
                    of the given cards will be higher.
                </p>
                <p>The second part of this step required storing these items into a relational database and making a way
                    to retrieve such data. For that, some of the endpoints provided are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An endpoint that returns a set of random cards with its corresponding character name, picture
                        and power score.</li>
                    <li>An endpoint that returns a set of random questions.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="gameLogic">
                <h3><span>3.2 </span>Game logic</h3>
                <p>
                    As previously stated, at the start of the game the player will receive various quiz questions that
                    will determine the average power of the cards he will receive. After the player has given his answer
                    to the question, the program will make a SparkQL query to verify if the answers were correct and
                    afterwards head to the card game phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the card game phase, both the player and the computer will receive a hand of 10 cards. While the
                    cards given to the computer are random, the ones the player received are based on the results from
                    the quiz phase. A random dice will decide who goes first. Whenever it is their turn, the
                    computer/player will have to place down a card. If the card has a higher power than the previous
                    one, the chain continues, but if it has a lower power level, the opposite side gains points equal to
                    a proportion based on the chain length and the total score of the chain. In order to spice things
                    up, the power of the cards will sometimes be dynamically modified based on the card currently placed
                    on the table and its interactions with your cards in hand( for example: water card beats fire card,
                    so the water card will have a slightly higher power level). The game ends when both players have run
                    out of cards.

            <section id="ui">
                <h3><span>3.3 </span>UI</h3>
                <p>
                    The game contains 4 main UI components: the start menu, the questions menu, the card game menu and
                    the end screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the player starts the game, he will be greeted with the start menu. The start menu allows the
                    player to set the username, the number of cards both him and the computer will be given, which has
                    to be a multiple of 10, as well as a play button, which redirects him to the quiz section. Once the
                    play button is pressed, the game itself will start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every game will consist of multiple rounds which start with the quiz phase followed by the card
                    phase. As previously stated, the strength of the cards for the current round will be determined
                    based on how well the player answers the question. The quiz view will contain the question box
                    located at the centre of the screen, as well as 4 possible answers to the questions, out of which
                    only one is correct. After an answer is selected, the “Submit” button will be available at the
                    bottom right side of the screen. A “Back” button will also be available at the top left side of the
                    screen, which will let the player return to the main menu, should he choose to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After pressing the “Submit” button, the player is redirected to the card game phase. The view will
                    consist of two rows(one at the bottom, one at the top), representing the hand of cards each
                    contestant has. In the middle of the screen there will be a stack of cards representing the
                    previously placed cards, with the last one used being placed on top and the visible one. The cards
                    themselves will include the name of the character, an image of the character, as well as its power
                    stat. Under certain conditions, the cards will also be bordered with a green/red glow, representing
                    whether the power of the card has been increased/ lowered based on the card currently placed down.
                    Just like the questions menu, a “Back” button placed on the top left will return the player to the
                    main menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the required number of rounds have been finished, the player will be redirected to the end
                    screen. The end screen will show whether the player has won or lost, the number of points he has
                    acquired, as well as a leaderboard for the user to see how well he did compared to other players.

                    The project uses 4 main APIs and an additional one used for obtaining power stats for marvel super
                    heroes. Each API has a multitude of endpoints. Some may be relevant for our game and some may not
                    be. Therefore, it will be explained in this chapter which endpoints will be used in the development
                    of this project.

                    For each one of these four main APIs, the endpoints that were of interest to us were the endpoints
                    that expose data for a specific character. Our application will generate a card for each character
                    that will be used in the card game. A problem that arises for the Marvel API is that we couldn’t map
                    a certain score to a superhero. The solution was to use an additional API, called SuperHero API.
                    This API offers power stats for any marvel superhero.

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    The term <em>Linked Data</em> refers to a set of best practices for publishing and interlinking
                    structured data
                    on the Web. In order to contribute to an environment where information is easily accessible, data
                    should
                    first be made available in a standard format that can be reached and processed by Semantic Web
                    tools.
                    This is achieved by respecting the four principles of Linked Data:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use URIs as names for things.</li>
                    <li>Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names.</li>
                    <li>When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (RDF*, SPARQL).
                    </li>
                    <li>Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things.</li>
                </ol>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                The project tries to conform to these principles through approaches such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each card will be identified by a URI.</li>
                <li>The data about de cards will be described using RDF. An early example can be observed in the
                    previous chapter.</li>
                <li>The entities will contain links to other data of interest or to other entities (e.g. card X is
                    duelling with card Y)
                </li>
            </ul>
